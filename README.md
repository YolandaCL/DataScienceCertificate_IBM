#  Data Science Capstone 
Data Science Capstone is the final course within the "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate" 

The aim of this project is to showcase the outcomes of tasks in modules and labs,  
and includes a presentation prepared for peer-data-scientists.

The presentation included is [ds-capstone.pptx](URL_donde_se_encuentra_el_archivo).

## Executive Summary
*We start by collecting diverse and relevant data from various sources.  
Next, we enhance data quality through data wrangling.  
Then we explore the data using SQL skills, perform statistical analysis and data visualization,  
and further explore by grouping data. Building predictive models uncovers insights.  
Finally, we conclude by creating accurate results and 
visualizations  
where ‘_less is more effective, more attractive, and more impactful_’.*

## Introduction   
In this capstone project, the aim is to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage,   
a key factor in reducing launch costs. 

## Methodology
The methodology is explained in the presentation.

## Results and Conclusion 
The Results and the Conclusion are included in the attached files.  
I have made an effort to document them in the code files provided,  
ensuring that the results are explained within the code itself.

##  Innovative Insights
In 'Lab 1: Collecting the Data,' we address the challenge of dealing with  
highly heterogeneous names of flights. It's noteworthy that launches from the East Coast  
are significantly more successful than those from the West Coast.  This raises an intriguing question:  
Could similar results have been achieved if the launches were conducted on the opposite coast?  
<br />
Another minor detail is the absence of seismic activity information, in the vast amount of data we have.  
Therefore, it might be advisable to seek out this type of data to enrich and complete our dataset.
